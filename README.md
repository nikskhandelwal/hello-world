*The goal is to turn data into information and information into insight! - Carly Fiorina*

 As rightly said above, my goal is always to talk to data, understand it throughly and then bring the data to life with some insights from the data and the surrondings influencing positively and negatively on the data. Over the course of my data science experience, I have worked on some cool projects that I want to showcase here.
